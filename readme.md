# installing

using this is quite simple and very automated please use this script below to install nav for team fortress 2.
```
git clone --recursive -b nav https://github.com/Lesshy/config;cd config;sudo cp -R nav\ meshes/* ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Team\ Fortress\ 2/tf/maps;sudo chmod 755 -R ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Team\ Fortress\ 2/tf/maps;cd ..;sudo rm -r config
```

there is a chance this won't work because i'm currently not on a "managable computer" for testing it
